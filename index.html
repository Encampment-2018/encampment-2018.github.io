          <p>
            The Encampment is a long-standing Stake tradition that happens every four years.
            It’s an opportunity to gather the Young Men of the Stake to enjoy the challenges of high adventure and Boy Scout advancement under the direction and guidance of the Stake Presidency and Stake Young Men Presidency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our camp theme is from an October 2011 General conference talk, “<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/10/it-is-better-to-look-up?lang=eng">It Is Better to Look Up</a>” by Carl B. Cook of the Seventy.
            Elder Cook describes a conversation with President Thomas S. Monson at a time when Elder Cook was feeling overwhelmed: “He smiled and lovingly suggested, while pointing heavenward, ‘It is better to look up!’”

          <p>
            Elder Cook extended that lesson to all of us, that we should always strive to look to the Savior, especially when we are feeling overwhelmed.
            He concluded with this testimony:
          </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
            “We are Heavenly Father’s children. He wants to be a part of our lives, to bless us, and to help us.
            He will heal our wounds, dry our tears, and help us along our path to return to His presence. As we look to Him, He will lead us.”
            </blockquote>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Schedule</h2>
          <p>
            To provide a meaningful long-term camp experience for the Deacons, our Aaronic Priesthood Encampment will begin on Tuesday night, May 29, and will conclude in the early afternoon of Saturday, June 2.
            For Teachers and Priests, camp runs May 30 through June 2. These young men should arrive at camp the afternoon of Wednesday, May 30.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Deacons, camp will include merit badge work typical of a BSA camp during the morning hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
            In the afternoons, each ward will be assigned to one of three groups for an assigned activity each day.
            The three afternoon activities are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Service project</li>
            <li>Swimming, Canoeing, or Fishing merit badges at Blue Ridge Reservoir</li>
            <li>Rifle Shooting, Archery, or Horsemanship merit badges at camp</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
            Saturday morning, while the Teachers and Priests are working on their service project, the Deacons will have a game of Capture the Flag.
            This will also be the time for Stake and Ward leaders to finish any paperwork related to merit badges.
          </p>
